Nodes provide instant access to powerful GPU and CPU resources for AI development, machine learning, rendering, and other compute-intensive workloads.

You have full control over your computing environment, allowing you to customize software, storage, and networking to match your exact requirements.

When you're ready to get started, [follow this tutorial](/get-started) to create an account and deploy your first Node.

## Key components

Each Node consists of these core components:

- **Container environment**: An Ubuntu Linux-based container that can run almost any compatible software.
- **Unique identifier**: Each Node receives a dynamic ID (e.g., `2s56cp0pof1rmt`) for management and access.
- [Storage](#storage-options):
    - **Container volume**: Houses the operating system and temporary storage.
    - **Disk volume**: Persistent storage that is preserved between Node starts and stops.
    - **Network volume (optional)**: Permanent, portable storage that can be moved between machines and persists even after Node deletion.
- **Hardware resources**: Allocated vCPU, system RAM, and multiple GPUs (based on your selection).
- **Network connectivity**: A proxy connection enabling web access to any [exposed port](/nodes/configuration/expose-ports) on your container.

## Node templates

[Node templates](/nodes/templates/overview) are pre-configured Docker image setups that let you quickly spin up Nodes without manual environment configuration. They're essentially deployment configurations that include specific models, frameworks, or workflows bundled together.

Templates eliminate the need to manually set up environments, saving time and reducing configuration errors. For example, instead of installing PyTorch, configuring JupyterLab, and setting up all dependencies yourself, you can select an official Brightnode PyTorch template and have everything ready to go instantly.

## Storage

Nodes offer three types of storage to match different use cases:

Every Node comes with a resizable **container disk** that houses the operating system and stores temporary files, which are cleared after the Node stops.

**Volume disks** provide persistent storage that is preserved throughout the Node's lease, functioning like a dedicated hard drive. Data stored in the volume disk directory (`/workspace` by default) persists when you stop the Node, but is erased when the Node is deleted. 

Optional [network volumes](/nodes/storage/network-volumes) provide more flexible permanent storage that can be transferred between Nodes, replacing the volume disk when attached. When using a Node with network volume attached, you can safely delete your Node without losing the data stored in your network volume directory (`/workspace` by default).

To learn more, see [Storage options](/nodes/storage/types).

## Deployment options

You can deploy Nodes in several ways:

- [From a template](https://docs.brightnode.cloud/nodes/templates/overview): Pre-configured environments for quick setup of common workflows.
- **Custom containers**: Pull from any compatible container registry such as Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or Amazon ECR.
- **Custom images**: Build and deploy your own container images.
- **From Serverless repos**: Deploy any Serverless-compatible repository from the [Brightnode Hub](/hub/overview#deploy-as-a-node) directly as a Node, providing a cost-effective option for consistent workloads.

<Note>

When building a container image for Brightnode on a Mac (Apple Silicon), use the flag `--platform linux/amd64` to ensure your image is compatible with the platform.

</Note>

## Connecting to your Node

Once deployed, you can [connect to your Node](/nodes/connect-to-a-node) through:

- **SSH**: Direct [command-line access](/nodes/configuration/use-ssh) for development and management.
- **Web proxy**: HTTP access to [exposed web services](/nodes/configuration/expose-ports) via URLs in the format `https://[node-id]-[port].proxy.brightnode.net`.
- **API**: Programmatic access and control through the [Brightnode API](/api-reference/nodes/POST/nodes).
- **JupyterLab**: A web-based IDE for data science and machine learning.
- **VSCode/Cursor**: [Connect to your Node with VSCode or Cursor](/nodes/configuration/connect-to-ide), working within your volume directory as if the files were stored on your local machine.

## Data transfer

You can transfer data from your Node to [most major cloud providers](/nodes/storage/cloud-sync), and to your local machine using the [Brightnode CLI](/brightnodectl/overview).

To learn more about all available options, see [Transfer files](/nodes/storage/transfer-files).

## Customization options

Nodes offer extensive customization to match your specific requirements.

You can select your preferred [GPU type](/references/gpu-types) and quantity, adjust system disk size, and specify your container image.

Additionally, you can configure custom start commands, set [environment variables](/nodes/references/environment-variables), define [exposed HTTP/TCP ports](/nodes/configuration/expose-ports), and implement various [storage configurations](nodes/storage/types) to optimize your Node for your specific workload.

## Node types

Brightnode offers two types of Node:

- **Secure Cloud:** Operates in T3/T4 data centers, providing high reliability and security for enterprise and production workloads.
- **Community Cloud:** Connects individual compute providers to users through a vetted, secure peer-to-peer system, with competitive pricing options.

## Deploy a Node

Follow these steps to deploy a Node:

1. [Choose a Node](/nodes/choose-a-node) based on your computing needs and budget.
2. Navigate to the [Node creation page](https://console.brightnode.cloud/node/create).
3. Configure your Node settings, including GPU type, storage, and networking options.
4. Launch your Node and connect using SSH, JupyterLab, or your preferred remote access method.
5. [Manage your Node](/nodes/manage-nodes) through the Brightnode console.

## Pricing

Nodes are billed by the minute with no fees for ingress/egress. Brightnode also offers long-term [savings plans](/nodes/pricing#savings-plans) for extended usage patterns. See [Node pricing](/nodes/pricing) for details.

## Limitations

**Docker Compose is not supported:** Brightnode runs Docker for you, so you cannot spin up your own Docker instance or use Docker Compose on Nodes. If your workflow requires Docker Compose, create a custom template with a pre-built Docker image that contains all necessary components.

**UDP connections are not supported:** Nodes only support TCP and HTTP connections. If your application relies on UDP, you'll need to modify your application to use TCP-based communication instead.

**Windows support:** Nodes do not currently support Windows.

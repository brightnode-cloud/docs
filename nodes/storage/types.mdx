Choosing the right type of storage is crucial for optimizing your workloads, whether you need temporary storage for active computations, persistent storage for long-term data retention, or permanent, shareable storage across multiple Nodes.

This page describes the different types of storage options available for your Nodes, and when to use each in your workflow.

## Container disk

A container disk houses the operating system and provides temporary storage for a Node. It's created when a Node is launched and is directly tied to the Node's lifecycle.

## Volume disk

A volume disk provides persistent storage that remains available for the duration of the Node's lease. It functions like a dedicated hard drive, allowing you to store data that needs to be retained even if the Node is stopped or rebooted.

The volume disk is mounted at `/workspace` by default (this will be replaced by the network volume if one is attached). This can be changed by [editing your Node configuration](#modifying-storage-capacity).

## Network volume

[Network volumes](/storage/network-volumes) offer persistent storage similar to the volume disk, but with the added benefit that they can be attached to multiple Nodes, and that they persist independently from the Node's lifecycle. This allows you to share and access data across multiple instances or transfer storage between machines, and retain data even after a Node is deleted.

When attached to a Node, a network volume replaces the volume disk, and by default they are similarly mounted at `/workspace`.

<Note>

Network volumes must be attached during Node creation, and cannot be unattached later.

## Choosing the right storage

Here's what you should consider when selecting storage for your Nodes:

*   **Data persistence needs:** Does your data need to survive Node restarts or deletions?
*   **Performance requirements:** Do your applications require very high-speed I/O, or is standard performance sufficient?
*   **Data sharing:** Do you need to share data between multiple Nodes?

## Modifying storage capacity

To update the size of a Node's container or volume disk:

1. Navigate to the [Node page](https://console.brightnode.cloud/node) in the Brightnode console.
2. Click the three dots to the right of the Node you want to modify and select **Edit Node**.
3. Adjust the storage capacity for the container or volume disk. Volume disk size can be increased, but not decreased.
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

<Warning>

Editing a running Node will cause it to reset completely, erasing all data that isn't stored in your volume disk/network volume mount directory (`/workspace` by default). 

</Warning>

## Transferring data to another cloud provider

You can upload data from your Node to AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Dropbox, and more by clicking the **Cloud Sync** button on the Node page. For detailed instructions on connecting to these services, see [Export data](/nodes/storage/cloud-sync).

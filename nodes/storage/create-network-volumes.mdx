Network volumes offer persistent storage that exists independently of the lifecycle of a Node. This means your data is retained even if a Node is terminated. They can be attached to multiple Nodes, making them ideal for sharing data, transferring storage between machines, or maintaining datasets.

When attached to a Node, a network volume replaces the Node's default volume disk and is typically mounted at ` /workspace`.

For a comparison with other storage types, see [Storage options](/nodes/storage/types).

<Warning>

If your account lacks sufficient funds to cover storage costs, your network volume may be terminated. Once terminated, the disk space is immediately freed for other users, and Brightnode cannot recover lost data. Ensure your account remains funded to prevent data loss.

</Warning>

## When to use a network volume

Consider using a network volume when you need:

*   **Persistent data that outlives individual Nodes:** Keep your data safe and accessible even after a Node is terminated.
*   **Shareable storage:** Share data across multiple Nodes by attaching the same network volume.
*   **Portable storage:** Easily move your working environment and data to a different Node, perhaps in a different GPU pool if your preferred option isn't available.
*   **Efficient data management:** Store frequently used models or large datasets to avoid re-downloading them for each new Node, saving time and bandwidth.

<Note>

  Network volumes are only available for Nodes in the Secure Cloud. For more information, see [Node types](/nodes/overview#node-types).

## Create a network volume

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Web">
To create a new network volume:

1.  Navigate to the [Storage page](https://www.console.brightnode.cloud/user/storage) in the Brightnode console.
2.  Select **New Network Volume**.
3.  **Configure your volume:**
    * Select a datacenter for your volume. Datacenter location does not affect pricing, but the datacenter location will determine which GPU types your network volume can be used with.
    *   Provide a descriptive name for your volume (e.g., "project-alpha-data" or "stable-diffusion-models").
    *   Specify the desired size for the volume in gigabytes (GB).
    
    <Warning>
    
    Network volume size can be increased later, but cannot be decreased.
    
    </Warning>

4.  Select **Create Network Volume**.

You can edit and delete your network volumes using the [Storage page](https://www.console.brightnode.cloud/user/storage).

</Tab>

<Tab title="REST API">
To create a network volume using the REST API, send a POST request to the `/networkvolumes` endpoint:

**Create a network volume:**
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://rest.brightnode.cloud/v1/networkvolumes \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer BRIGHTNODE_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "my-network-volume",
  "size": 50,
  "dataCenterId": "US-KS-2"
}'
```

For complete API documentation and parameter details, see the [network volumes API reference](/api-reference/network-volumes/POST/networkvolumes).

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Attach a network volume to a Node

<Note>

Network volumes must be attached during Node deployment. They cannot be attached to a previously-deployed Node, nor can they be unattached later without deleting the Node.

</Note>

To deploy a Node with a network volume attached:

1. Navigate to the [Nodes page](https://www.console.brightnode.cloud/nodes).
2. Select **Deploy**.
3. Select **Network Volume** and select the network volume you want to attach to the Node from the dropdown list.
4. Select a GPU type. The system will automatically tell you which Nodes are available to use with the selected network volume.
5. Select a **Node Template**.
5. If you wish to change where the volume mounts, select **Edit Template** and adjust the **Volume Mount Path**.
4. Configure any other fields as you normally would, then select **Deploy On-Demand**.

Data from the network volume will be accessible to the Node from the volume mount path, which is set to `/workspace` by default. Use this directory to upload, download, and manipulate data, and share it with other Nodes.

## Share data between Nodes

You can attach a network volume to multiple Nodes, allowing them to share data seamlessly. Multiple Nodes can read files from the same volume concurrently, but you should avoid writing to the same file simultaneously to prevent conflicts or data corruption.

## S3-compatible API

Brightnode provides an S3-compatible API that allows you to access and manage files on your network volumes directly, without needing to launch a Node. This can be particularly useful for:

- **Uploading large datasets or models** before launching your Node.
- **Managing files remotely** without maintaining an active Node connection.
- **Automating data workflows** using standard S3 tools and libraries.
- **Reducing costs** by avoiding the need to keep Nodes running for file management.

The S3-compatible API supports standard S3 operations including file uploads, downloads, listing, and deletion. You can use it with popular tools like the AWS CLI and Boto3 (Python).

For detailed setup instructions, authentication, and usage examples, see the [S3-compatible API documentation](/serverless/storage/s3-api).

<Note>
The S3-compatible API is currently available for network volumes in the following datacenters: `EUR-IS-1`, `EU-RO-1`, `EU-CZ-1`, `US-KS-2`, `US-CA-2`.

## Architecture details

Network volumes are backed by high-performance storage servers co-located with Brightnode GPU servers. These are connected via high-speed networks and use NVMe SSDs for optimal performance, but data transfer speeds can vary widely based on location and network conditions (200-400MB/s, up to 10GB/s).

## Benefits

Using network volumes provides significant flexibility that can lead to cost savings, especially if you need to frequently switch between Nodes or share large datasets.

Network volume storage space costs less than for disk volumes (\$0.07/GB/month rather than \$0.10/GB/month), and storing data on a network volume can save you money compared to provisioning separate disk space for multiple Nodes (even with just two Nodes sharing one volume).

## Migrate files between volumes

You can migrate files from one network volume to another using `brightnodectl send` and `receive` on two running Nodes. Watch this video tutorial for a step-by-step walkthrough:

Bnodes provide instant access to powerful GPU and CPU resources for AI development, machine learning, rendering, and other compute-intensive workloads.

You have full control over your computing environment, allowing you to customize software, storage, and networking to match your exact requirements.

When you're ready to get started, [follow this tutorial](/get-started) to create an account and deploy your first Bnode.

## Key components

Each Bnode consists of these core components:

- **Container environment**: An Ubuntu Linux-based container that can run almost any compatible software.
- **Unique identifier**: Each Bnode receives a dynamic ID (e.g., `2s56cp0pof1rmt`) for management and access.
- [Storage](#storage-options):
    - **Container volume**: Houses the operating system and temporary storage.
    - **Disk volume**: Persistent storage that is preserved between Bnode starts and stops.
    - **Network volume (optional)**: Permanent, portable storage that can be moved between machines and persists even after Bnode deletion.
- **Hardware resources**: Allocated vCPU, system RAM, and multiple GPUs (based on your selection).
- **Network connectivity**: A proxy connection enabling web access to any [exposed port](/bnodes/configuration/expose-ports) on your container.

## Bnode templates

[Bnode templates](/bnodes/templates/overview) are pre-configured Docker image setups that let you quickly spin up Bnodes without manual environment configuration. They're essentially deployment configurations that include specific models, frameworks, or workflows bundled together.

Templates eliminate the need to manually set up environments, saving time and reducing configuration errors. For example, instead of installing PyTorch, configuring JupyterLab, and setting up all dependencies yourself, you can select an official Brightnode PyTorch template and have everything ready to go instantly.

## Storage

Bnodes offer three types of storage to match different use cases:

Every Bnode comes with a resizable **container disk** that houses the operating system and stores temporary files, which are cleared after the Bnode stops.

**Volume disks** provide persistent storage that is preserved throughout the Bnode's lease, functioning like a dedicated hard drive. Data stored in the volume disk directory (`/workspace` by default) persists when you stop the Bnode, but is erased when the Bnode is deleted. 

Optional [network volumes](/bnodes/storage/network-volumes) provide more flexible permanent storage that can be transferred between Bnodes, replacing the volume disk when attached. When using a Bnode with network volume attached, you can safely delete your Bnode without losing the data stored in your network volume directory (`/workspace` by default).

To learn more, see [Storage options](/bnodes/storage/types).

## Deployment options

You can deploy Bnodes in several ways:

- [From a template](https://docs.brightnode.io/bnodes/templates/overview): Pre-configured environments for quick setup of common workflows.
- **Custom containers**: Pull from any compatible container registry such as Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or Amazon ECR.
- **Custom images**: Build and deploy your own container images.
- **From Serverless repos**: Deploy any Serverless-compatible repository from the [Brightnode Hub](/hub/overview#deploy-as-a-bnode) directly as a Bnode, providing a cost-effective option for consistent workloads.

<Note>

When building a container image for Brightnode on a Mac (Apple Silicon), use the flag `--platform linux/amd64` to ensure your image is compatible with the platform.

</Note>

## Built-in utility services

Every Bnode comes with pre-configured utility services for development, monitoring, and ML workflows. These services run automatically and are accessible via your browser with no additional setup required.

**All templates include:**
- **JupyterLab**: Interactive notebooks with Python and GPU support.
- **VS Code Server**: Full IDE running in your browser.
- **System Monitor**: Real-time CPU, GPU, and memory statistics.
- **File Browser**: Web-based file upload and download interface.

Specialized templates include additional tools like TensorBoard for PyTorch/TensorFlow, vLLM API server for LLM inference, Open WebUI for chat interfaces, and ComfyUI for Stable Diffusion workflows.

To learn more about all available services and how to use them, see [Built-in utility services](/bnodes/utility-services).

## Connecting to your Bnode

Once deployed, you can [connect to your Bnode](/bnodes/connect-to-a-bnode) through:

- **SSH**: Direct [command-line access](/bnodes/configuration/use-ssh) for development and management.
- **Web proxy**: HTTP access to [exposed web services](/bnodes/configuration/expose-ports) via URLs in the format `https://[bnode-id]-[port].brightnode.cloud`.
- **API**: Programmatic access and control through the [Brightnode API](/api-reference/bnodes/POST/bnodes).
- **Built-in services**: Pre-configured [utility services](/bnodes/utility-services) like JupyterLab, VS Code, and monitoring tools.
- **VSCode/Cursor**: [Connect to your Bnode with VSCode or Cursor](/bnodes/configuration/connect-to-ide), working within your volume directory as if the files were stored on your local machine.

## Data transfer

You can transfer data from your Bnode to [most major cloud providers](/bnodes/storage/cloud-sync), and to your local machine using the [Brightnode CLI](/brightnodectl/overview).

To learn more about all available options, see [Transfer files](/bnodes/storage/transfer-files).

## Customization options

Bnodes offer extensive customization to match your specific requirements.

You can select your preferred [GPU type](/references/gpu-types) and quantity, adjust system disk size, and specify your container image.

Additionally, you can configure custom start commands, set [environment variables](/bnodes/references/environment-variables), define [exposed HTTP/TCP ports](/bnodes/configuration/expose-ports), and implement various [storage configurations](bnodes/storage/types) to optimize your Bnode for your specific workload.

## Bnode types

Brightnode offers two types of Bnode:

- **Secure Cloud:** Operates in T3/T4 data centers, providing high reliability and security for enterprise and production workloads.
- **Community Cloud:** Connects individual compute providers to users through a vetted, secure peer-to-peer system, with competitive pricing options.

## Deploy a Bnode

Follow these steps to deploy a Bnode:

1. [Choose a Bnode](/bnodes/choose-a-bnode) based on your computing needs and budget.
2. Navigate to the [Bnode creation page](https://console.brightnode.cloud/deploy).
3. Configure your Bnode settings, including GPU type, storage, and networking options.
4. Launch your Bnode and connect using SSH, JupyterLab, or your preferred remote access method.
5. [Manage your Bnode](/bnodes/manage-bnodes) through the Brightnode console.

## Pricing

Bnodes are billed by the minute with no fees for ingress/egress. Brightnode also offers long-term [savings plans](/bnodes/pricing#savings-plans) for extended usage patterns. See [Bnode pricing](/bnodes/pricing) for details.

## Limitations

**Docker Compose is not supported:** Brightnode runs Docker for you, so you cannot spin up your own Docker instance or use Docker Compose on Bnodes. If your workflow requires Docker Compose, create a custom template with a pre-built Docker image that contains all necessary components.

**UDP connections are not supported:** Bnodes only support TCP and HTTP connections. If your application relies on UDP, you'll need to modify your application to use TCP-based communication instead.

**Windows support:** Bnodes do not currently support Windows.

Get started with setting up your Brightnode projects using JavaScript. Whether you're building web applications, server-side implementations, or automating tasks, the Brightnode JavaScript SDK provides the tools you need. This guide outlines the steps to get your development environment ready and integrate Brightnode into your JavaScript projects.

## Install the Brightnode SDK

Before integrating Brightnode into your project, you'll need to install the SDK. Using Bnode.js and npm (Bnode Package Manager) simplifies this process. Ensure you have Bnode.js and npm installed on your system before proceeding.

To install the Brightnode SDK, run the following npm command in your project directory.

```bash
npm install --save Brightnode-sdk
# or
yarn add Brightnode-sdk
```

This command installs the `Brightnode-sdk` package and adds it to your project's `package.json` dependencies. For more details about the package, visit the [npm package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/Brightnode-sdk) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Brightnode/js-sdk).

## Add your API key

To use the Brightnode SDK in your project, you first need to import it and configure it with your API key and endpoint ID. Ensure these values are securely stored, preferably as environment variables.

Below is a basic example of how to initialize and use the Brightnode SDK in your JavaScript project.

```javascript
const { BRIGHTNODE_API_KEY, ENDPOINT_ID } = process.env;
import brightnodeSdk from "Brightnode-sdk";

const Brightnode = BrightnodeSdk(BRIGHTNODE_API_KEY);
const endpoint = brightnode.endpoint(ENDPOINT_ID);
```

This snippet demonstrates how to import the SDK, initialize it with your API key, and reference a specific endpoint using its ID. Remember, the Brightnode SDK uses the ES Module (ESM) system and supports asynchronous operations, making it compatible with modern JavaScript development practices.

### Secure your API key

When working with the Brightnode SDK, it's essential to secure your API key. Storing the API key in environment variables is recommended, as shown in the initialization example. This method keeps your key out of your source code and reduces the risk of accidental exposure.

<Info>

Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions to handle sensitive information like API keys.

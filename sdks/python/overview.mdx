Get started with setting up your Brightnode projects using Python. Depending on the specific needs of your project, there are various ways to interact with the Brightnode platform. This guide provides an approach to get you up and running.

## Install the Brightnode SDK

Create a Python virtual environment to install the Brightnode SDK library. Virtual environments allow you to manage dependencies for different projects separately, avoiding conflicts between project requirements.

To get started, install setup a virtual environment then install the Brightnode SDK library.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="macOS">
Create a Python virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">
Create a Python virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

```bash
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Linux">
Create a Python virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

To install the SDK, run the following command from the terminal.

```bash
python -m pip install brightnode
```

You should have the Brightnode SDK installed and ready to use.

## Get Brightnode SDK version

To ensure you've setup your Brightnode SDK in Python, choose from one of the following methods to print the Brightnode Python SDK version to your terminal.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Pip">
Run the following command using pip to get the Brightnode SDK version.

```bash
pip show Brightnode
```

You should see something similar to the following output.

```bash
Brightnode==1.7.9
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Shell">
Run the following command from your terminal to get the Brightnode SDK version.

```bash
python3 -c "import brightnode; print(brightnode.__version__)"
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Python">
To ensure you've setup your installation correctly, get the Brightnode SDK version. Create a new file called `main.py`. Add the following to your Python file and execute the script.

```py
import brightnode

version = brightnode.version.get_version()

print(f"Brightnode version number: {version}")
```

You should see something similar to the following output.

```sh
Brightnode version number: 1.X.0
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

You can find the latest version of the Brightnode Python SDK on [GitHub](https://github.com/Brightnode/Brightnode-python/releases).

Now that you've installed the Brightnode SDK, add your API key.

## Add your API key

Set `api_key` and reference its variable in your Python application. This authenticates your requests to the Brightnode platform and allows you to access the [Brightnode API](/sdks/python/apis).

```python
import brightnode
import os

brightnode.api_key = os.getenv("BRIGHTNODE_API_KEY")
```

<Info>

It's recommended to use environment variables to set your API key. You shouldn't load your API key directly into your code.

For these examples, the API key loads from an environment variable called `BRIGHTNODE_API_KEY`.

</Info>

Now that you've have the Brightnode Python SDK installed and configured, you can start using the Brightnode platform.

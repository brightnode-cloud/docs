Follow this guide to learn how to create an account, deploy your first GPU Bnode, and use it to execute code remotely.

## Step 1: Create an account

Start by creating a Brightnode account:

1. [Sign up here](https://www.console.brightnode.cloud/signup).
2. Verify your email address.
3. Set up two-factor authentication (recommended for security).

<Tip>
  Planning to share compute resources with your team? You can convert your personal account to a team account later.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Deploy a Bnode

Now that you've created your account, you're ready to deploy your first Bnode:

1. Open the [Deploy Bnode](https://www.console.brightnode.cloud/deploy) in the web interface.
2. Step through the options on the page and choose a GPU option
3. Review your Bnode summary and attach storage if necessary.
4. In the field under **Bnode Name**, keep the default provided or change the name.
6. Click **Deploy Bnode** to deploy and start your Bnode. You'll be redirected to the Bnode Management page after a few seconds.

<Note>
  If you haven't set up payments yet, you'll be prompted to add a payment method and purchase credits for your account.
</Note>

## Step 3: Explore the Bnode detail pane

On the [My Bnodes](https://www.console.brightnode.cloud/my-bnodes) page you can click on the Bnode card to explore Metrics and Logs. You also have action buttons on the card which provide options for connecting to your Bnode so you can execute code on your GPU (after it's done initializing which can take 5-6 minutes, hit refresh to check if it is running).

You'll find several [built-in utility services](/bnodes/utility-services) including JupyterLab, VS Code Server, system monitoring, and file browser—all pre-configured and ready to use with no setup required.

Take a minute to explore the other tabs:

- **Details**: Information about your Bnode, such as hardware specs, pricing, and storage.
- **Metrics**: Realtime utilization metrics for your Bnode's CPU, memory, and storage.
- **Logs**: Logs streamed from your container (including stdout from any applications inside) and the Bnode management system.

## Step 4: Execute code on your Bnode with JupyterLab

1. Click on the JupyterLab button to open a JupyterLab workspace on your Bnode.
2. Under **Notebook**, select **Python 3 (ipykernel)**.
3. Type `print("Hello, world!")` in the first line of the notebook.
4. Click the play button to run your code.

And that's it—congrats! You just ran your first line of code on Brightnode.

## Step 5: Clean up

To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, follow these steps to clean up your Bnode resources:

1. Return to the [My Bnodes page](https://www.console.brightnode.cloud/bnodes) and click your running Bnode.
2. Click the **Stop** button (pause icon) to stop your Bnode.
3. Click **Stop Bnode** in the modal that opens to confirm.

You'll still be charged a small amount for storage on stopped Bnodes (\$0.20 per GB per month). If you don't need to retain any data on your Bnode, you should terminate it completely.

To terminate your Bnode:

1. Click the **Terminate** button (trash icon).
2. Click **Terminate Bnode** to confirm.

<Warning>
  Terminating a Bnode permanently deletes all data that isn't stored in a [network volume](/storage/network-volumes). Be sure that you've saved any data you might need to access again.

  To learn more about how storage works, see the [Bnode storage overview](/bnodes/storage/types).
</Warning>

## Next steps

Now that you've learned the basics, you're ready to:

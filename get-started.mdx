Follow this guide to learn how to create an account, deploy your first GPU Bnode, and use it to execute code remotely.

## Step 1: Create an account

Start by creating a Brightnode account:

1. [Sign up here](https://www.console.brightnode.cloud/signup).
2. Verify your email address.
3. Set up two-factor authentication (recommended for security).

<Tip>

Planning to share compute resources with your team? You can convert your personal account to a team account later. See [Manage accounts](/get-started/manage-accounts) for details.

</Tip>

## Step 2: Deploy a Bnode

Now that you've created your account, you're ready to deploy your first Bnode:

1. Open the [Bnodes page](https://www.console.brightnode.cloud/bnodes) in the web interface.
2. Click the **Deploy** button.
3. Select **A40** from the list of graphics cards.
4. In the field under **Bnode Name**, enter the name **quickstart-bnode**.
5. Keep all other fields (Bnode Template, GPU Count, and Instance Pricing) on their default settings.
6. Click **Deploy On-Demand** to deploy and start your Bnode. You'll be redirected back to the Bnodes page after a few seconds.

<Note>

If you haven't set up payments yet, you'll be prompted to add a payment method and purchase credits for your account.

</Note>

## Step 3: Explore the Bnode detail pane

On the [Bnodes page](https://www.console.brightnode.cloud/bnodes), click the Bnode you just created to open the Bnode detail pane. The pane opens onto the **Connect** tab, where you'll find options for connecting to your Bnode so you can execute code on your GPU (after it's done initializing which can take 5-6 minutes, hit refresh to check if it is running).

Take a minute to explore the other tabs: 

- **Details**: Information about your Bnode, such as hardware specs, pricing, and storage.
- **Telemetry**: Realtime utilization metrics for your Bnode's CPU, memory, and storage.
- **Logs**: Logs streamed from your container (including stdout from any applications inside) and the Bnode management system.
- **Template Readme**: Details about the template your Bnode is running. Your Bnode is configured with the latest official Brightnode PyTorch template.

## Step 4: Execute code on your Bnode with JupyterLab

1. Go back to the **Connect** tab, and under **HTTP Services**, click **Jupyter Lab** to open a JupyterLab workspace on your Bnode.
2. Under **Notebook**, select **Python 3 (ipykernel)**.
3. Type `print("Hello, world!")` in the first line of the notebook.
4. Click the play button to run your code.

And that's it—congrats! You just ran your first line of code on Brightnode.

## Step 5: Clean up

To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, follow these steps to clean up your Bnode resources:

1. Return to the [Bnodes page](https://www.console.brightnode.cloud/bnodes) and click your running Bnode.
2. Click the **Stop** button (pause icon) to stop your Bnode.
3. Click **Stop Bnode** in the modal that opens to confirm.

You'll still be charged a small amount for storage on stopped Bnodes (\$0.20 per GB per month). If you don't need to retain any data on your Bnode, you should terminate it completely.

To terminate your Bnode:

1. Click the **Terminate** button (trash icon).
2. Click **Terminate Bnode** to confirm.

<Warning>

Terminating a Bnode permanently deletes all data that isn't stored in a [network volume](/storage/network-volumes). Be sure that you've saved any data you might need to access again.

To learn more about how storage works, see the [Bnode storage overview](/bnodes/storage/types).

</Warning>

## Next steps

Now that you've learned the basics, you're ready to:

* [Generate API keys](/get-started/api-keys) for programmatic resource management.
* Experiment with various options for [accessing and managing Brightnode resources](/get-started/connect-to-Brightnode).
* Learn how to [choose the right Bnode](/bnodes/choose-a-bnode) for your workload.
* Review options for [Bnode pricing](/bnodes/pricing).
* [Explore our tutorials](/tutorials/introduction/overview) for specific AI/ML use cases.
* Start building production-ready applications with [Brightnode Serverless](/serverless/overview).

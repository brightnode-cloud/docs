## [Brightnode console](https://console.brightnode.cloud)

The web interface for managing your compute resources, account, teams, and billing.

## [Bnode](/bnodes/overview)

A dedicated GPU or CPU instance for containerized AI/ML workloads, such as training models, running inference, or other compute-intensive tasks.

## [Network volume](/storage/network-volumes)

Persistent storage that exists independently of your other compute resources and can be attached to multiple Bnodes or Serverless endpoints to share data between machines.

## [Brightnode Hub](/hub/overview)

A repository for discovering, deploying, and sharing preconfigured AI projects optimized for Brightnode.

## Container

A Docker-based environment that packages your code, dependencies, and runtime into a portable unit that runs consistently across machines.

## Data center

Physical facilities where Brightnode's GPU and CPU hardware is located. Your choice of data center can affect latency, available GPU types, and pricing.

## Machine

The physical server hardware within a data center that hosts your workloads. Each machine contains CPUs, GPUs, memory, and storage.

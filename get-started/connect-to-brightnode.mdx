Brightnode offers multiple ways to access and manage your compute resources. Choose the method that best fits your workflow:

## Brightnode console

The Brightnode console provides an intuitive web interface to manage Bnodes and endpoints, access Bnode terminals, send endpoint requests, monitor resource usage, and view billing and usage history.

[Launch the Brightnode console →](https://www.console.brightnode.cloud)

## Connect directly to Bnodes

You can connect directly to your running Bnodes and execute code on them using a variety of methods, including a built-in web terminal, an SSH connection from your local machine, a JupyterLab instance, or a remote VSCode/Cursor development environment.

## REST API

The Brightnode REST API allows you to programmatically manage and control compute resources. Use the API to manage Bnode lifecycles and Serverless endpoints, monitor resource utilization, and integrate Brightnode into your applications.

## SDKs

Brightnode provides SDKs in Python, JavaScript, Go, and GraphQL to help you integrate Brightnode services into your applications.

## Command-line interface (CLI)

The Brightnode CLI allows you to manage Bnodes from your terminal, execute code on Bnodes, transfer data between Brightnode and local systems, and programmatically manage Serverless endpoints.

Every Bnode comes pre-installed with the `brightnodectl` command and includes a Bnode-scoped API key for seamless command-line management.

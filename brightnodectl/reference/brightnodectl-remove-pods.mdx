Terminate multiple Pods that share the same name. This is useful for cleaning up groups of Pods created with the `create pods` command.

<RequestExample>
```sh Command
brightnodectl remove pods <name> [flags]
```
</RequestExample>

## Example

Terminate all Pods named "training-worker":

```sh
brightnodectl remove pods training-worker
```

## Arguments

<ResponseField name="<name>" type="string" required>
The name of the Pods to terminate. All Pods with this exact name will be removed.
</ResponseField>

## Flags

<ResponseField name="--podCount" type="integer">
The number of Pods with the specified name to terminate. This limits the removal to a specific count rather than removing all matching Pods.
</ResponseField>
